# Examplechain
This Project is a realization of an example of the functionality of the blockchain technology.
The used programming language is JAVA.
The aim of this project was to display in detail how a blockchain works and transfers value from one to another.
The documentation is available in german. An english version will follow up.

To realize the encription with SHA256 I used the library called "BouncyCastle". Feel free to include it locally to your machine.

Moreover this is limited by local functionallity, which means there aren't any network functions included.

Ofir Knimach
